# ToastContainer

The brains behind the operation, a wrapper around an event driven architecture which is fast, responsive and performant. Accepts the following props:

## Props

The `ToastContainer` component accepts the same parameters as the `toast` function, and additionally receives other global props (margin, limit and newestOnTop):

- ### type: `"default"|"success"|"warning"|"error"|"info"`

  The type of the toast, it provides a visual cue as to the nature of the message.

- ### theme: `"filled"|"outlined"|"glass"`

  The theme of the toast.

- ### animation: `"pop"|"fade"|"slide"`

  The type of animation used to animate the toast in and out of the screen.

- ### autoClose: `false|number`

  The period after which a toast should automatically close.

- ### closeOnClick: `boolean`

  If `true` the toast is clickable anywhere on its surface, a click causes the toast to close.

- ### limit: `false|number`

  The maximum amount of toasts displayed in a single position on the screen, when the limit is reached, the toasts are enqueued and shown when a free spot is available.

- ### margin: `"normal"|"dense"`

  This controls the distance between the edge of the screen and the displayed toast.

  Display the newest toasts on top.

- ### pauseOnHover: `boolean`

  If `true` the user can pause the countdown of the autoClose period.

  THe toasts list position on the screen.

- ### showCloseButton: `boolean`

- ### showIcon: `boolean`

  Each toast type, except `default`, has its own `Icon`, this flag controls whether it is visible or not.

- ### role: `string`
